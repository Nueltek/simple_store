This project was developed using React, Chakra UI, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with the primary goal of learning and practicing basic backend CRUD operations. React powers the frontend interface, while Node.js and Express handle the server-side logic. MongoDB serves as the database for storing product data. Overall, it's a simple web application designed to help me gain hands-on experience with fullstack development and database communication.
